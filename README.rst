thonny-icontract-hypothesis is a plug-in for `Thonny IDE`_ to automatically test
Python code using `icontract-hypothesis`_.

.. _Thonny IDE: https://thonny.org/
.. _icontract-hypothesis: https://github.com/mristin/icontract-hypothesis


Installation
============
In Thonny
---------
The plug-in can be easily installed *via* Thonny.
Go to ``Tools`` menu and select ``Manage plug-ins...``:

With pip
--------
In your virtual environment, invoke:

.. code-block::

    pip install --user thonny-icontract-hypothesis

Usage
=====
To check all the functions in the file with `icontract-hypothesis`, go to ``Tools``
menu and select ``Test the current file with icontract-hypothesis``:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mristin/thonny-icontract-hypothesis/main/readme/tools_test.png
    :alt: Tools->Test

All changes to the file will be saved prior to executing the tests.
If you prefer, you can undo them.

The tests will be executed in the Thonny shell:

You can stop the tests with the "Stop" sign:

Sometimes it is practical to test only a single function (*e.g.*, if it takes too long
to test the whole file).
In that case, move the caret to the body of the function that you would like to test,
go to ``Tools`` menu and select ``Test the function under the caret with
icontract-hypothesis``:
